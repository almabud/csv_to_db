# csv_to_db

It read a csv file from "/media/" and then save it to data base.
Here I used pandas for reading csv file and for saving use pandas data frame to_sql() function.

# Save CSV

For saving the csv file just start the server using python manage.py runserver command and then go to localhost:8000/save_csv/


# See the saved data

For seeing the saved data just go to localhost:8000/index/
This page will show a table.
